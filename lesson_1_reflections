How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Helped quickly identify the differences in code text and will help save significant time

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Can quickly go back if we end up making a mistake or breaking something

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Having discretion can make saves more meaningful to go back to in the future, but forgetting to save can cause huge setbacks if an error happens

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Docs within google docs are less related to each other and hence tend to be treated separately, while systems like Git work on things that are more interrelated, hence makes more sense to save multiple files in one commit.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows all of the commits that were made previously, and git diffs compares each version's differences

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Will be able to revert back to a previous version if any changes break stuff, hence acts as a safety net

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Would like to learn javascript and create some projects with Git/GitHub
